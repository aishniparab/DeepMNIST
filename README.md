DeepMNIST
---
Learning how to build a convolutional neural network model in TensorFlow to
recognise handwritten digits.

### Usage

1. `python cnn_mnist.py`: Trains a cnn on the MNIST database to recognise images. Will print logs and accuracy results.
2. `python mnist_onevsall`: Trains a cnn on MNIST database to recognise if an image is 7 or not. 


### Network

The network is based on [this TensorFlow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers).

### Database

The MNIST dataset has 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of
handwritten digits 0-9. These images is 28x28 pixels of monochrome images.
